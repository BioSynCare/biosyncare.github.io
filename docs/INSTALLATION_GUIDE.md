## Troubleshooting

### Install button doesn't appear

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser doesn't support PWAs (use Chrome/Edge)
2. App already installed (check if icon exists)
3. HTTPS not enabled (only works on localhost or HTTPS sites)

**Solution:**
- Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari
- Check if app is already installed
- Try the browser menu method instead

### App won't install

**Check:**
1. Browser is up to date
2. Enough disk space available
3. Not in incognito/private mode

**Solution:**
- Update browser to latest version
- Free up disk space
- Use normal browsing mode

### Install icon disappeared after dismissing

**Why:** Chrome only shows the prompt once per session after dismissal.

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh page: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache
- Or use the on-page "Install App" button

### Update notification keeps appearing

**Why:** Service worker has an update but wasn't activated.

**Solution:**
- Click "Update Now" button
- Or close all instances of the app and reopen
- Or: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → "Update on reload"

  const accepted = await pwaInstaller.promptInstall();
  console.log(accepted ? 'User installed!' : 'User dismissed');
}

// Check if already installed

  console.log('Running in standalone mode');
