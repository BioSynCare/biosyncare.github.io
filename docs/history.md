# October-dicembre 2020

I was reading and meditating a lot, have moved to a small house
in the front of my mom, the top of a mountain in Petropolis.

I was reading and meditating a lot.
Most mythology, cristian writtings, the Bible.
Friends were telling me people were loosing their mind.
Partial lockdowns in Brasil.

I decided to do something.
Started a neuromodulation initiative.
Decided to take was I learned in music,
change ringuing, static sounds, sonic pictures,
such as brainwave entrainment tecniques,
such as binaural beats, isochronous sounds,
blinking and undulating lights.

I've created and used them in myself,
uncovering effects quite distinct between themselves.
With one sonic picture (there are 5 of them),
people reported heading "echoes" of teeth and mandubular movements.
With the first trio (oboe, clarinet, flute),
a person reported being in an "altered state" for
2 days or so.

For myself, they are fun to use,
you can perceive different qualities of
cognition, of thought and ways to tackle
input from the environment.

And they are healthy.
For myself I can say it helped me though
doing many things I would not have had the patience,
or the energy or whatnot.
My companion Juliana have used these gadgets many times as well,
mainly to work.
Write essays, answer emails, do what is there to do.
Sometimes she tells me about how much it has helped
in this or that.

In 1st January 2001 we started, me and Otávio Martigli,
to meet people online who were seeking help.
We would talk with them, do one 15 minute session of
sensory stimulation, all together, and talk about it.

We did that until Semptember 2001.

(I started writing this document using a 12Hz isochronous
and am hearing it still)

I would often wake up before 6AM and go to bed after 22PM.
We idealized both 30min and 1h sessions,
often deviating to more than such,
but we could usually keep sessions around such
30 min and 1h.

People we talked to were often suicidal.
Problems were as diverse as they come,
we were talking with people online,
that we found in Facebook Groups.
We would tell about the initiative
and would then talk to them.

Results I saw first hand:

- People would tell me they were not taking medication for muscular pain.
- People would tell me they do not have migranes anymore.
- After about 3-5 days, with +- daily 1h sessions, suicidal people would tell me they didn't want to die anymore.
- Ansiety problems ammeliorated.
- Insomnia problems ammeliorated.
- Benefits for myself in terms of mental sharpness, awareness, wellbeing and general health. I tended to see that in others, but within people that were seeking health, and got those benefits, it is also natural to notice a difference.

Caution here to consider these results:

- Scientifically, I am the person who did the "experiment", who performed the activity, to which I am myself reporting the outcome. We have tecniques to overcome this bias in the results.
- As far as I remember, ** Every ** single one of the people that came to the online neurosensory stimulation sessions got benefits.
  Every single one of the people with suicidal tendencies reported getting well in just ~3-5 sessions of ~1h, 15 minutes of the sensory stimulation. This looks suspect. I explain it by myself by it being either A) a biased result, period. I distorted what I saw because I am the experimenter; or B) the sessions were so effective in the general wellbeing, in a holistic sense, that there were always such positive outcomes; and/or C) people that stuck doind the sessions wanted to please me and Otávio and would state having benefits, because they wanted the friendship or to take part in that we were doing.

On the positive side, aligned with such strong results:

- Neurosensory stimulation is has indeed shown scientific evidence of helping in a broad spectrum of cases, from pain management, to cognitive enhancement.
- The cocktail of such sessions went beyond Neurosensory stimulation, which was perfomed in 15 minutes. We empirically arrived in a mix of 1) yes, neurosensory stimulation, specially audio; 2) slow rithmic breathing, guided through audiovisual cues;

3. Support groups, because we were meeting and talking for the first 15-30 minutes, and the last 30-45 minutes, talking about anything and about the problem/thing to solve; 4) .
