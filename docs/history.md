# October-dicembre 2020

I was reading and meditating a lot, have moved to a small house
in the front of my mom, the top of a mountain in Petropolis.

I was reading and meditating a lot.
Most mythology, cristian writtings, the Bible.
Friends were telling me people were loosing their mind.
Partial lockdowns in Brasil.

I decided to do something.
Started a neuromodulation initiative.
Decided to take was I learned in music,
change ringuing, static sounds, sonic pictures,
such as brainwave entrainment tecniques,
such as binaural beats, isochronous sounds,
blinking and undulating lights.

I've created and used them in myself,
uncovering effects quite distinct between themselves.
With one sonic picture (there are 5 of them),
people reported heading "echoes" of teeth and mandubular movements.
With the first trio (oboe, clarinet, flute),
a person reported being in an "altered state" for
2 days or so.

For myself, they are fun to use,
you can perceive different qualities of
cognition, of thought and ways to tackle
input from the environment.

And they are healthy.
For myself I can say it helped me though
doing many things I would not have had the patience,
or the energy or whatnot.
My companion Juliana have used these gadgets many times as well,
mainly to work.
Write essays, answer emails, do what is there to do.
Sometimes she tells me about how much it has helped
in this or that.

In 1st January 2001 we started, me and Otávio Martigli,
to meet people online who were seeking help.
We would talk with them, do one 15 minute session of
sensory stimulation, all together, and talk about it.

We did that until Semptember 2001.

(I started writing this document using a 12Hz isochronous
and am hearing it still)
